Consumers and other 
stakeholders can scan the code to verify the product's authenticity. Once the code has been 
scanned, it cannot be used again, and attempting to do so will trigger an error message indicating that 
the code is invalid. The technology keeps a permanent and transparent record of every product's 
movement and storing its information and accompanying hash data on the 
blockchain. By using blockchain technology, the system ensures that the information stored in the QR 
Code cannot be tampered with or altered, providing a secure and reliable means of verifying product 
authenticity. The QR Code can be protected from multiple scans using a scratch-off system by only 
revealing the code after the scratch-off material has been removed. The system has the potential to 
significantly reduce the prevalence of counterfeit products, protect public health and safety, and 
promote trust and transparency in the marketplace.
